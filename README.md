# angular-ionic-boilerplate

Boilerplate project with all the necessary configurations like LINTing, TESTing and so on.

## Hooks

In the `.husky/` directory we can see that we have a `pre-commit` and a `pre-push` hook. Before every commit we execute prettier and eslint, before every push we execute all the tests running ng test.

If you have any further enhancements feel free to add them, I will gradually implement further improvements in terms of CI/CD and code productivity.
